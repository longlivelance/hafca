title: 'Workplace Drug Testing'
---

Drug testing in the workplace is not universal, and is regulated by various governmental agencies at the

federal, state and municipal levels, as well as by various industries. Safety-sensitive occupations are 

typically targeted, and various industries and agencies have differing drug-testing protocols. In the 

United States, drug testing is highly structured and much of it falls under the purview of Presidential 

Executive Order # 12564 [http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-

order/12564.html] issued in 1986, and subsequent legislation following a multiple-death and injury train 

collision in 1987 (the train engineer and his brakeman had been smoking marijuana at the time of the 

crash). 

Most workplace drug testing programs test only for what are referred to as the “NIDA-5”: heroin, 

cocaine, amphetamine, marijuana and PCP, as well as alcohol. While illicit drug use spurred widespread 

drug testing in the U.S., legitimately prescribed medications which may impact safety in the workplace 

are a growing issue which has not yet been fully addressed (“Do not drive or operate heavy machinery 

while using this medication.”). Many companies establish Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) 

[http://www.dol.gov/odep/documents/employeeassistance.pdf], which are designed to help businesses 

address productivity issues. The EAP provides various services to behaviorally-affected employees to 

alleviate and resolve issues, including substance abuse, with their job performance.

Workplace drug testing [https://www.transportation.gov/odapc/] as mandated by the U.S. Department 

of Transportation is highly structured. Samples are matched to employees through a rigorous chain of 

custody, and are reviewed by a certified Medical Review Officer (MRO)[ 

https://www.transportation.gov/odapc/mro] . Various regulations govern not only negative and positive 

results, but also dilutes, split samples, false positives and negatives, and presumed negatives.
