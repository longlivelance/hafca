title: 'Adolescent v. Adult Addiction'

>The adolescent brain is often likened to a car with a fully functioning gas pedal (the reward system) but weak brakes (the prefrontal cortex). **– NIDA**

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a wealth of information and publications aboutadolescent substance use disorder. https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-adolescent-substance-use-disorder-treatment-research-based-guide/introduction Most of what we know about addiction is based on observation and treatment of adults. Increasingly, young people evidence signs of addiction, such as:

* Changes in friends and personality
* Family conflict increases
* School disciplinary action increases
* School performance declines
* Health  and moral compass declines

Because the brain isn’t fully developed until about age 25 and patterns of behavior and personality are being laid down, it’s more susceptible to the distractions of drug effects. Cannabis, stimulants such as Adderall, and opioids are being used with increasing frequency. Alcohol has always been available Because the adolescent pre-frontal cortex, which governs decision-making and moderates social behavior, isn’t fully developed, young people are more likely to experiment with substances that can interfere with the growth and stabilization of the pre-frontal cortex functions.

Timmen Cermak, MD, former President of the California Society of Addiction Medicine, who has specialized in treating adolescents with cannabis issues, says that “Addiction is a pediatric disease.”

The latest research and clinical experience therefore suggest that young people should be put into treatment as soon as drug-addled behavior appears, not wait until they hit “bottom” as has been the rule for adults. Kids need habilitation, i.e. to learn good habits; adults need re-habilitation, i.e. to (presumably) re-learn good habits. Adult pre-addiction psychological pathology is an important assessment criteria.
