Oxford Houses [www.OxfordHouse.org] 

An Oxford House is a democratically run, self-supporting and drug-free home for 6-15 residents who 

desire to prevent relapse. First organized in 1975 with a single house in Maryland, the Oxford House 

model has now been adopted by approximately 2000 houses, primarily in urban areas. 

Halfway Houses

These programs often include a treatment and monitoring component, particularly for those mandated 

by the criminal justice system. Residents usually have a pre-determined departure date (unless their 

actions spur a premature departure). These facilities are regulated and licensed, and have on-site staff

Three-Quarter Way Houses

These homes typically offer a “no tolerance” drug/alcohol-free environment where residents are 

encouraged to attend AA, NA or other programs. Residents provide mutual support while treatment is 

provided by licensed professionals outside the house.

Sober Living on Campus

Colleges and universities are increasingly encouraging sober living facilities or areas on-campus. If the 

school doesn’t have on-campus options, its counseling center may have resources for off-campus 

recovery-oriented housing and related services. 

Recovery High Schools

Recovery high schools are secondary schools designed specifically for students in recovery from 

substance use disorder or dependency. The schools share the goals of educating students who are in 

recovery from substance use disorder or co-occurring disorders; meeting state requirements for a 

diploma; and supporting students in their recovery programs. In addition to teaching and administrative 

staff, recovery high schools typically also include substance abuse counselors and mental health 

professionals who support students entering the recovery lifestyle and their families. The Association of 

Recovery Schools [https://recoveryschools.org/] provides a locator for recovery high schools and related 

support services.
