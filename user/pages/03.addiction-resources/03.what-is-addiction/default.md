WHAT IS ADDICTION?

The ASAM Definition of Addiction

Very briefly, “Addiction is a chronic brain disease and there are treatments available to help patients.” 

ASAM also has longer, more detailed definitions:

Screening Tools

A number of screening tools have been developed to assist clinicians in determining whether an 

individual has an addiction and/or how severe it is. Others assist in determining the level of dependence 

or addiction.

National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)

practice/screening-assessment-drug-testing-resources/chart-evidence-based-screening-tools-adults]

Several screening tools are listed. The COWS (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale) was first reported in the 

Journal of Psychoactive Drugs [link to JPD pages] (Wesson & Ling, 2003).

National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

A consumer-oriented screening tool for alcohol; also includes a calorie counter and looks at how 

different mixed drink cocktails compare in alcohol content.

Blood Alcohol Concentration

The concentration of alcohol in the blood (BAC) depends on many factors, including weight, gender, 

whether and what you’ve been eating, and how fast you consumed the alcohol. 

[http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/what-standard-drink]. 

Whether you’re drinking beer or whiskey is not a factor – see below. States’ laws differ as to what level 

of BAC constitutes drunk driving. A consistently high BAC can lead to a variety of health problems; 

stopping long-term alcohol use is best done under the guidance of a physician in an environment 

capable of appropriate levels of medical support.

Beer v Wine v Spirits

Many people think of beer as “not as strong” as, say, a whiskey and soda. Nonetheless, a glass/can of 

beer packs an equivalent punch to a shot of schnapps.

Process Addictions

Certain compulsive behaviors are now increasingly identified with the term “process addictions” 

because they have the same effect of “lighting up” the brain as the more well-known/accepted drug and 

alcohol addictions. Among these compulsive behaviors are gambling (recognized as an addictive 

behavior in the recently released Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)), 

Internet gaming, shopping/spending, eating, and sexual activity. There is some dispute, however, as to 

whether these behaviors are true addictions or fall into the category of obsessive compulsive behaviors.

Process Addictions

which is pretty anonymous. Looks like it may be a (clever) recruiting/marketing site

Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP)

The majority of states have established Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) that act as 

statewide electronic databases of the controlled medications prescribed by physicians to specific 

patients. Physicians can use the data to determine whether patients are collecting prescriptions from 

multiple physicians, thus reducing the possibility of overprescribing leading to overdose, abuse, and/or 

diversion (sales to a third party).
